            <p>
                It’s vital for everyone, especially children and teens, to learn early on who they can trust with their information on the Internet.
                While there are security programs and privacy settings to be aware of, which can help block things like computer viruses and tracking cookies
                and protect your online privacy, you don’t need a master’s in cybersecurity to keep yourself or your family safe. It can’t be stressed enough
                how important it is to create a very strong password for any accounts you have online. Starting from an early age, kids can learn about how
                important it is to ask for permission before creating an account or downloading a file, for example. By developing skills pertaining to privacy
                and safety on the Internet, kids can lay a strong foundation for their rest of their digital lives.

            <h3>What is a Digital Footprint?</h3>
            <!--general information-->
            <p>
                A digital footprint is all of the information online about a person either posted by that person or others, intentionally or unintentionally.
                Filling out a form, leaving a blog comment, updating your status, checking into a location, emailing or IMing a friend, posting a photo, visiting
                a website, using a search engine… everything you do online leaves a trail. This trail is your digital footprint. Understanding how to manage your
                online reputation or “digital footprint” is a challenging process. To complicate matters further, it’s not just your own online actions you need to
                worry about—what others say and post about you also contributes to your digital footprint.

            <h3>Tips For Keeping Your Digital Footprint Safe</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Always remember to log off when you have finished with an online service.</li>
                <li>Do not enter your password on a website using free public Wi-Fi. Hackers on the network can snoop on what you’re doing.</li>
                <li>Remember that most of the websites you visit will make a note of your visit and may also track the websites you visit before and after their website.</li>
                <li>When you sign up for a new social media site, or when you buy something, you are giving personal information to the people who manage those websites. That information is often shared, circulated, and sometimes sold.</li>
                <li>Remember that anyone can copy and paste anything you say online, and they can then send it to others, or publish it on the internet.</li>
            </ul>
