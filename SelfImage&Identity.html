            <!--general information and advice on helping students learn-->
            <h3>Overview:</h3>

            <p>
                Your online identity is not the same as your real-world identity. Every website you browse, shop from, or log on to ‘sees’ you and your characteristics differently.
                For instance, when you shop or purchase items, that site begins to establish a partial identity for you or whomever is using your name or identity.
                So, as each site is visited and viewed, your identity is being added to or enhanced. Birthdate information, favorite color, best friend, whether or not you own a pet, likes and dislikes are all being collected as your surf and post.
                Some of this information is under your control; some may not be or may even be invisible to you. All of it contributes to ‘who you are and what you do.’
                This is known as your digital identity. <a href=https://www.sdhc.k12.fl.us/doc/list/internet-safety/self-image-identity/177-854/" target="_blank" title="Source">Source</a>

            <h3>Help Your Students:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Learn how individuals interpret messages differently, how values and points of view are included or excluded, and how media can influence beliefs and behaviors.</li>
                <li>Recognize that photos can be altered digitally and consider the upsides and downsides of this practice.</li>
                <li>Reflect on benefits and risks to presenting their identities in different ways online.</li>
                <li>Evaluate from an ethical point of view the feelings, motivations, contexts, and possible outcomes associated with adopting different roles online.</li>
                <li>Reflect on the positive and negative impact digital media have on themselves and on society.</li>
            </ul>
