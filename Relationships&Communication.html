            <h3>Overview:</h3>

            <p>
                <b>What is CYBERBULLYING and DIGITAL DRAMA?</b>
                Online cruelty, also referred to as cyberbullying, takes place whenever someone uses digital media tools such as the Internet and cell
                phones to deliberately upset or harass someone else, often repeatedly. While spreading rumors and bullying is nothing new for kids, online
                tools can magnify the hurt, humiliation, and social drama in a very public way. Cyberbullying can take a variety rumors or post cruel
                comments or images online. The feeling of being anonymous or “removed” from a target in an online environment can encourage a kid who
                normally wouldn’t say anything mean face-to-face to act irresponsibly or unethically. With the effects of cyberbullying ranging from
                low self-esteem to depression to thoughts of violence or suicide, it is important for parents, teachers and students alike to learn how
                to prevent cyberbullying and stop it in its tracks.
