            <h3>Overview:</h3>
            <!--general information-->
            <p>
                Kids live in a "copy/paste culture" where they often think, if it's online, it's mine! Most teachers have experienced some kind of problem
                with student plagiarism and/or improper citation (or lack thereof). In a digital age, it's more important than ever that students learn
                about copyright, fair use, and attribution. And, in a digital age we no longer cite just the quotes we use from a book or article, but the
                images, videos, and websites we use too.
                <br>
                <br>
                The term creative work refers to all types of information and documents designed or written by someone including writing of all kinds,
                artwork, photos, videos, and music. There are many ways we use creative work we find online today such as using a photo in a report,
                posting it on a website or your Facebook page, or even as simple as forwarding it on your cell phone. Before using work created by others,
                there are many things that should be taken into consideration. There are specific laws that protect the work of others; these laws are
                called copyright laws.
                <br>
                <br>
                Copyright laws protect the owner and the work they created from pirated use. (Pirated use refers to something that is duplicated and/or
                distributed without authorization or permission.) First you must consider if the owner will allow the work to be copied and used and if so,
                then how or where the owner will allow its use. So, by asking who owns it, do I have permission to use it, and where am I allowed to use it,
                the first steps in respecting creative copy and copyright laws are being observed.
